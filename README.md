# Blogging App Demo
## Project Overview
This project is based upon a tutorial on building a blogging service on the example of Reddit offered by Sai Upadhyayula from Tech Mahindra in 2019: https://github.com/SaiUpadhyayula/spring-reddit-clone.git.
The Springboot based backend exposes several REST APIs to be consumed by a frontend service. For a documentation of the various get and post endpoints consult the in-built Swagger user interface at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.
